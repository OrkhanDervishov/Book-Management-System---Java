This management system is one of the best softwares for book lovers. It aims to collect the book gourmets together and simplify the process of writing and managing reviews for books. It is a Java-based application designed to manage user reviews and ratings, helping to save them in a safe and organized way. The system allows users to share their opinions, rate books, and explore reviews submitted by others. 

**Key features of the system include:**
+ **User Reviews:** Users can write detailed reviews for books they have read, sharing their thoughts and opinions with others.
+ **Book Ratings:** Users can assign ratings to books on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, helping others gauge the popularity and quality of a book.
+ **User Interaction:** The system provides an intuitive interface for users to browse reviews, edit their own reviews, and interact with the book database.

## Installation

To install the Book Review System on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the Repository: Use Git to clone the project repository to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
<div>
    <pre>
        <code class="language-bash" id="git-clone-code">
            git clone https://github.com/your-username/ADA-SITE-CSCI-1202/team-project-team-50.git
        </code>
    </pre>
    <button class="copy-button" data-clipboard-target="#git-clone-code"></button>
</div>

Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username. This command will download the entire project files to your computer.

3. Navigate to the Project Directory: Once the cloning process is complete, navigate to the project directory using the cd command:
